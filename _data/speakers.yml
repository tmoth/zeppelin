  name: "Carol"
  surname: "Bausor"
  company: "Toastmasters"
  title: ""
  bio: "Carol joined Toastmasters in 2010, after being convinced that, since she often went to Paris for business, she could certainly organise herself to go there twice a month for Toastmasters meetings! She enjoyed it so much and, since there was no club in her home town of Lyon, she created one!  Today she is a member of 3 clubs, and is also one of the District Assistants for Club Creation, a job she enjoys very much.  Carol discovered that she really loves competing, but as a Trainer by profession, this year she jumped at the chance to be Pathways Ambassador, (and continue to compete!).<br/><br/>Carol was rather surprised that the clubs she was asked to advise are ... in The Netherlands!  She decided the best way to be of service was first of all to get to know them by actually coming to the Division Conference on April 14th.  She is totally impressed by  Pathways, and looking forward to sharing her enthusiasm.
